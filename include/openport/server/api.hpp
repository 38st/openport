/// 30m, 1h (starting at half past) or 1d (starting at the 09:30 ET open), and
/// limit (1-5000) keeps the most recent bars. See CandleStore for their sources.
/// Expiry ids are the date plus settlement, e.g. "2026-10-16AM", because SPX
/// (morning settlement) and SPXW (afternoon) can expire on the same day.
/// OEX and XEO additionally carry -OEX or -XEO to distinguish exercise styles.
/// Status and ticks include market {open, note, next_open}; this uses wall-clock
/// regular-session hours, while as_of remains the market data's timestamp.
/// next_open uses the same UTC timestamp format as as_of; null while open.
/// Each status/tick underlyings[] entry also includes session {name, open, note}
/// at wall-clock time, where name is regular/curb/global/closed for that product.
/// paper {accepting, reason, message} uses the new-order session/feed gate with
/// the data clock, provider delay and current max_quote_age. Success has null
/// reason/message; contract, risk and write-access checks still apply separately.
/// has_tradable_contracts is true when unexpired slices contain a contract eligible
/// for paper trading (standard European index or American equity/ETF options).
/// Portfolio session notices use this flag, or held positions/open orders.
/// The top-level market remains the regular-session calendar for compatibility.
/// All four underlying views include spot_source ("quote", "parity", or null).
/// Summary includes american_approximation (any priced American expiry without
/// de-Americanisation) and
/// coverage {options, quoted, priced, open_interest} over live standard contracts.
/// summary.expiries[] and chain.expiry include style ("european"/"american") and
/// the same coverage counts. Quoted/OI counts mean received, including real zeros;
/// priced means the option has its own valid IV, not just its strike's smile IV.
/// Each expiry includes rate_source: "parity" (this expiry's fitted rate), "term"
/// (borrowed from this underlying's longer European expiries), "curve" (another
/// underlying's European parity curve), or "assumed" (flat fallback). rate_fitted
/// remains true only for "parity". rate_curve_symbol names the curve (e.g. "SPX")
/// for "curve", otherwise null. deamericanized reports EEP removal with an LR
/// tree. Chain bid/ask/mid remain the raw market quotes; iv/bid_iv/ask_iv use
/// premium-adjusted prices. Each option includes eep, the per-unit price premium
/// used for those solves (null when not computed, zero when computed as zero).
/// Greeks remain European Black-76 Greeks at the final smile IV, accurate OTM.
/// Chain bid/ask/mid and oi are null when never received; invalid values are null.
/// Exposure summaries include oi_coverage: received OI / options at finite-smile-IV strikes,
/// or null for an empty set. This covers the full exposure, regardless of display
/// window/expiry filters. Every side at those strikes with usable OI contributes risk, even without
/// its own IV.
/// Surface preserves the market points and adds points[].svi_iv (decimal IV/null).
/// Each expiry adds svi: {a,b,rho,m,sigma,rmse_vol_points,points,status,reason,
/// fit_ms,butterfly_min_g,butterfly_k,butterfly_ok}, or null when fitting fails.
/// svi_status (ok/too_few_points/failed), svi_reason, svi_points and svi_fit_ms
/// remain available even when svi is null. svi_years and svi_min_k/svi_max_k give
/// the high-precision tenor and calibration range for dense client-side curve sampling.
/// Parameters describe TOTAL variance at k=ln(K/F); rmse_vol_points is in percent.
/// Butterfly fields report a 2,001-point density check over the calibration range,
/// not a global no-arbitrage certificate. Undefined density fails the check.
/// calendar_violations: [{earlier: expiry id, later: expiry id, k, vol_points,
/// tolerance_vol_points}] compares consecutive successful fits ordered by T over
/// their calibration-range intersection. vol_points is the later-expiry IV increase
/// needed to remove the crossing; tolerance is max(0.1 vp, both fit RMSEs, both
/// locally interpolated quoted IV half-spreads in vp). Reports the largest flagged
/// increase and its local tolerance. Diagnostics never repair raw SVI fits.
/// Top-level ssvi: {rho,eta,gamma,rmse_vol_points,status,reason,monotone_adjusted,
/// fit_ms} describes one modified-power-law SSVI surface for all usable expiries.
/// status is ok/too_few_points/failed; parameters/RMSE are null on failure. Each
/// expiry adds ssvi_theta (ATM total variance), ssvi_rmse_vol_points, ssvi_reason,
/// ssvi_min_k/ssvi_max_k; points[].ssvi_iv is decimal IV/null. Missing ATM brackets
/// or unusable quotes skip that expiry (null theta/RMSE/IV, explicit reason).
/// A failed surface has null estimates and a top-level reason. Theta and parameters
/// retain full precision. See analytics/ssvi.hpp and docs/svi.md for constraints.
/// Fitting is lazy, outside the engine. Raw SVI fits only the requested expiry
/// prefix; SSVI fits the entire snapshot once, independent of window/prefix.
/// Successes and failures are cached for the immutable (symbol, metrics version)
/// snapshot, isolated by snapshot owner. Concurrent requests share fits; expired
/// snapshots release their cache entries. Window only filters displayed points.
