# SVI and SSVI volatility surfaces

OpenPort fits raw SVI independently to each expiry's out-of-the-money smile:

\[
k=\log(K/F),\qquad w(k)=a+b\{\rho(k-m)+\sqrt{(k-m)^2+\sigma^2}\},
\qquad IV(k)=\sqrt{w(k)/T}.
\]

Here **w is total variance**, T is years, and IV is decimal annual volatility.
These conventions follow Gatheral's raw SVI formulation; they matter when applying
wing bounds. The fit is descriptive: it does not repair arbitrage or interpolate
between expiries.

## Calibration

Use the chain's existing smile IV and the corresponding OTM side (call for K≥F,
put otherwise). Require finite positive bid, finite ask≥bid, and positive finite
bid IV≤smile IV≤ask IV. Missing, crossed, zero-bid and invalid IV markets do not
enter calibration. At least five distinct log-strikes and a range ≥1e-5 are needed.
Fitting uses the entire eligible expiry, independently of the API display window;
the existing market-display filter still hides price spreads above half the mid.

For IV spread s, initial weight is 1/max(s, 0.0001)². Cap it at four times the upper median
weight, then lower the common cap until no observation has more than 25% of the
normalized total weight. The spread floor is 0.01 vol points. Minimize weighted
**total-variance** squared residuals against IV²T. Report
100√Σ weight·(fitted IV−market IV)² as RMSE in vol points; it is a diagnostic in
vol units, not the minimized objective.

Following Zeliade's dimension reduction, fix (m,σ), put y=(k−m)/σ, c=bσ and d=ρc.
Then w=a+dy+c√(1+y²), a three-variable constrained least-squares problem. A primal
active-set quadratic solver handles the linear bounds. The curved minimum-variance
constraint is enforced by adding supporting planes at its analytic minimizer;
this allows negative a, unlike restricting a≥0. Only residuals ≤1e-12 in total
variance are rounded onto an active boundary. The inner solve has finite iteration
limits and rejects nonconvergence.

The outer search evaluates 20 fixed seeds: m at the range midpoint plus
{−0.5,−0.25,0,0.25,0.5} times the range, and σ at {0.05,0.15,0.4,1} times the range.
Refine the best four using two-dimensional Nelder–Mead in (m,log σ), at most 400
iterations each. Search bounds are midpoint±2 ranges for m and [1e-4,5] ranges for
σ. Convergence requires simplex widths below 1e-8 ranges in m and 1e-8 in log σ.
This is a deterministic bounded local search, not a global optimality guarantee.
Flat smiles can have non-identifiable parameters. Failure returns no parameters,
an explicit reason, eligible point count and measured time.

## Constraints and diagnostics

Enforce b≥0, |ρ|≤1−1e-7, σ>0 and a+bσ√(1−ρ²)≥0. The wing limit is
b(1+|ρ|)≤2, with numerical admissibility tolerance 1e-12, at every tenor.
Lee's moment formula bounds the slope of **total variance**, independent of T.
The previous 4/T cap was incorrect and has been removed, including for T>2.
See [Lee's moment formula](https://math.uchicago.edu/~rl/moment.pdf).

With x=k−m and h=√(x²+σ²), derivatives are w′=b(ρ+x/h), w″=bσ²/h³. Evaluate

\[
g(k)=\left(1-\frac{kw'}{2w}\right)^2-
\frac{(w')^2}{4}\left(\frac1w+\frac14\right)+\frac{w''}{2}
\]

on 2,001 uniformly spaced k values, including both calibration endpoints. Report
the minimum and its k. Any negative g fails; undefined density, including zero w,
also fails. For calendars, sort successful fits by T and compare consecutive pairs
across all settlement families on 2,001 points over the intersection of their
calibration ranges; skip disjoint ranges. At each k, the later expiry's IV increase
needed to remove a crossing is `100 * (sqrt(w_earlier / T_later) - sqrt(w_later / T_later))`
vol points. At each k, linearly interpolate each expiry's eligible two-sided
quoted IV half-width `(ask_iv - bid_iv)/2`, convert to vol points, and use the wider
of the two. The tolerance is `max(0.1, RMSE_earlier, RMSE_later,
100 * half_width_earlier(k), 100 * half_width_later(k))` vol points. Duplicate
quote k values use the widest half-spread. The full observed half-width is used,
without the weighting floor/cap. Fits with no quote metadata use the floor/RMSEs.
Flag only increases strictly above that local tolerance (plus 1e-12 roundoff).
Report the largest **flagged** increase, its k and the tolerance at that k;
a larger crossing inside a wider spread does not hide a smaller significant one.
No judgement is made about raw SVI extrapolation beyond quotes.

These are **finite-grid diagnostics**, not a global no-arbitrage certificate:
violations between grid points or outside the checked range can be missed, and
wing conditions alone do not ensure a valid density. Fits remain unchanged when a
check fails. Raw-SVI diagnostics say “Grid checks pass”, never “arbitrage-free”.

## SSVI: one arbitrage-free surface

For the entire underlying, fit a shared (ρ,η,γ) and an ATM total variance θ_t
per usable expiry:

\[
w(k,\theta_t)=\frac{\theta_t}{2}\left[1+\rho\varphi(\theta_t)k+
\sqrt{(\varphi(\theta_t)k+\rho)^2+1-\rho^2}\right],\qquad
\varphi(\theta)=\frac{\eta}{\theta^\gamma(1+\theta)^{1-\gamma}}.
\]

IV is √(w/T). This is Gatheral–Jacquier (2014), Eq. (4.1) with the modified
power law of Eq. (4.5), Remark 4.4. The implementation enforces θ_t>0,
nondecreasing θ_t in T, |ρ|<1, η>0, 0<γ≤1/2 and η(1+|ρ|)≤2.
The paper's **Theorem 4.1** requires nondecreasing θ and

\[
0\leq\frac{\partial_\theta(\theta\varphi)}{\varphi}
\leq\frac{1+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}{\rho^2}
\quad\text{(upper bound infinite at ρ=0)}.
\]

For this φ the middle quantity equals (1−γ)/(1+θ), so the condition holds.
**Theorem 4.2** requires θφ(1+|ρ|)<4 and θφ²(1+|ρ|)≤4 for butterflies.
Writing x=θ/(1+θ), θφ=ηx^(1−γ)<η and
θφ²=η²x^(1−2γ)(1−x)≤η². Our η bound implies both inequalities, including
strictness of the first. Thus **Corollary 4.1** supplies a static-arbitrage
certificate, rather than relying on the finite diagnostic grid.
See the [paper's Section 4](https://arxiv.org/html/1204.0646#S4).

The initial condition is θ_0=0 and θφ(θ)→0 as θ→0. If interpolating in time,
use a continuous nondecreasing θ curve (piecewise linear through (0,0) and the
calibrated knots is sufficient), and preserve monotonicity when extending it.
The API currently returns the fitted expiry knots rather than time interpolation.
The calendar interpretation uses proportional dividends and forward log-moneyness,
as in the paper's Lemma 2.1. No guarantee is asserted for market quotes themselves.

Calibration has two stages:

1. Reuse SVI's eligible OTM quotes. Interpolate **IV**, linearly in k at zero,
   then set θ=ATM IV²T. An exact ATM quote takes precedence; duplicate k values
   average their IVs. Require five distinct points spanning at least 1e-5 in k
   and quotes bracketing zero; skip unusable expiries with explicit reasons.
   Require at least two usable distinct tenors for a surface fit. Sort by T and
   run equal-expiry-weight pool-adjacent-violators regression on θ. Equal tenors
   are pooled first, ensuring identical θ there. `monotone_adjusted` reports
   whether the repair changed any θ beyond relative roundoff (1e-14).
2. Hold repaired θ fixed and minimize the weighted total-variance squared error
   across every usable expiry. Quote weights are **exactly** the same normalized
   per-expiry weights as SVI, so expiries have equal aggregate weight. Optimize
   (ρ,q,γ), where q=η(1+|ρ|)/2. Bounds are ρ∈[−1+1e-7,1−1e-7],
   q∈[1e-8,1], γ∈[1e-6,1/2]; small positive numerical floors exclude degenerate
   parameters. Evaluate 45 fixed seeds: ρ∈{−.8,−.4,0,.4,.8}, q∈{.15,.4,.8},
   γ∈{.15,.35,.5}. Refine the best four with bounded three-dimensional
   Nelder–Mead, at most 600 iterations each, until all simplex coordinate widths
   are <1e-9. This deterministic local search has no random restarts and no
   global-optimum claim. An unconverged fit returns a failure reason and null
   parameters. Per-expiry RMSE uses the same IV-unit diagnostic as SVI; overall
   RMSE is the square root of the mean per-expiry squared RMSE. Time includes
   quote preparation, theta repair, optimization and RMSE calculation.

Raw SVI uses five independent parameters per expiry and usually fits each smile
more tightly. Its ρ alone does not identify observed skew (m and σ also affect it),
and neither wing caps nor grid checks remove static arbitrage. SSVI ties the
expiries together, with ATM skew having the sign of its common ρ; it may have
larger residuals but supplies globally safe strike extrapolation. Sparse or flat
surfaces can still have weakly identified parameters. Tests convert SSVI to its
exact raw-SVI representation for the existing density and calendar checks, and
also test total-variance ordering directly without calendar tolerance.

## API and display

`/api/underlyings/{symbol}/surface` retains existing fields. Each expiry adds
`svi` with `a,b,rho,m,sigma,rmse_vol_points,points,status,reason,fit_ms,`
`butterfly_min_g,butterfly_k,butterfly_ok`; `points[].svi_iv` is decimal fitted IV.
A failed fit has `svi: null` and null point estimates. Expiry-level `svi_status`,
`svi_reason`, `svi_points`, `svi_fit_ms` preserve failure information.
`svi_years,svi_min_k,svi_max_k` support sampling without rounded-tenor errors.
Parameters retain full precision. Top-level `calendar_violations` contains
`{earlier,later,k,vol_points,tolerance_vol_points}` using existing expiry IDs;
it covers only returned expiries. `vol_points` is the full later-expiry IV increase, not the excess over
tolerance. `tolerance_vol_points` is the local threshold used. The table shows
the size, k and counterpart expiry for both members.

Top-level `ssvi` always contains
`{rho,eta,gamma,rmse_vol_points,status,reason,monotone_adjusted,fit_ms}`.
Parameters/RMSE are null on failure; status and reason remain available.
Each expiry adds `ssvi_theta`, `ssvi_rmse_vol_points`, `ssvi_reason`,
`ssvi_min_k`, `ssvi_max_k`, and each market point adds decimal `ssvi_iv`.
Skipped expiry theta/RMSE/IV are null with an expiry reason; if the entire
surface fails, all estimates are null and the top-level reason explains why.
Theta and shared parameters retain full precision for client curve sampling.

Fitting runs only in the surface API. A per-snapshot mutex coalesces concurrent
requests; the engine never takes it. Cache successes and failures for each
immutable (symbol, metrics version) snapshot, using weak snapshot ownership to
isolate different sources and remove expired entries on subsequent requests.
Larger expiry prefixes fit only the additional raw-SVI expiries. SSVI fits all
usable expiries in the underlying snapshot on its first request, independently
of the requested prefix; both successes and failures are cached. Changing the
prefix/window reuses the same shared SSVI fit. Calendar comparisons and JSON
serialization still run.

The Volatility view offers Market / SVI / SSVI / All, draws market dots and 241
samples uniform in k (also on the strike axis). Solid raw-SVI curves are clipped
to the requested window and calibration range; dashed SSVI curves cover the
requested window, including beyond quotes. The table shows shared SSVI parameters,
overall RMSE, fit time, any monotone adjustment, per-expiry θ and SSVI RMSE next to
SVI parameters/RMSE/counts and butterfly/calendar or failure labels. The explanation
reads “one surface, arbitrage-free by construction; per-expiry SVI fits tighter but
can admit arbitrage”. Colors use existing light/dark theme tokens.

## Validation and timing

Tests cover exact parameter recovery including negative a; bounded recovery under
small deterministic noise; short and long tenors; active constraints and flat
smiles; invalid, missing and degenerate inputs; capped quote weighting; determinism;
flat and known safe densities; Vogt's published butterfly counterexample; calendar
ordering; API fields, nulls, concurrent cache reuse, windows, prefixes and version
invalidation; and web sampling, toggles and diagnostic rendering. SSVI tests cover
exact and noisy recovery (positive/negative/zero ρ, including γ=1/2), constrained endpoints,
wide outlier weighting, ATM interpolation, missing ATM, invalid inputs, equal
maturity pooling and PAVA repair, determinism, grids to |k|=100 and θ from 1e-8
to 100, API fields/nulls, concurrent cold fits and cache invalidation.

Run the repeatable synthetic workload with `./build/bench/openport_measure_svi`.
It uses 250 OTM points per expiry, deterministic small IV noise, varying quote
spreads, 60 tenors from 2 days to about 2 years, five warmups and 25 timed samples.
The SSVI timing is one shared fit over all 15,000 points, including quote preparation and theta repair.
It is SPX-sized, **not a live SPX calibration accuracy measurement**. Local Release
build timings (ms):

| Workload | Median | p90 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| One SSVI surface fit, 60 × 250 points | 40.404 | 40.660 |
| One raw-SVI fit, 250 points, including butterfly check | 2.651 | 2.716 |
| 60 raw-SVI fits plus butterfly and calendar checks | 155.363 | 157.282 |
| Full API, cold SVI + SSVI and 15,000 serialized market points | 248.623 | 253.399 |
| Full API, cached fits, same points and calendar checks | 55.621 | 60.360 |

No time is added to the engine analytics pass. The first surface response pays
calibration cost on its API worker; repeated responses still pay serialization cost.
