# Configuration

Providers, command-line flags, terminal settings and who may write.

## Providers

| Provider | `--provider` | Data | Key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cboe delayed | `cboe` (default) | 15-minute delayed chain snapshots for US index and equity options, with session volume, open interest and Cboe's Greeks, polled every 15 s from Cboe's data files, or about once a minute from its quote pages when the files fall behind | none |
| Databento | `databento` | Real-time OPRA consolidated quotes (`cbbo-1s` or `cmbp-1`), trades and open interest, streamed | `DATABENTO_API_KEY` |
| Massive | `massive` | Option chain snapshots, real-time or delayed depending on your plan, polled every 5 s | `MASSIVE_API_KEY` |
| ThetaData | `thetadata` | Snapshots from your local Theta Terminal (v3), polled every 2 s | Theta Terminal login |
| Tradier | `tradier` | Option chain snapshots and underlying prices; production options are real-time, index timing is unconfirmed. Sandbox is 15-minute delayed. Polling follows the request budget. Not yet run live with an account; reports welcome | `TRADIER_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| tastytrade | `tastytrade` | Production DXLink option quotes, open interest, delta/gamma and underlying prices. Not yet run live with an account; reports welcome | `TASTYTRADE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TASTYTRADE_REFRESH_TOKEN`; optional `TASTYTRADE_CLIENT_ID` |
| Demo | `demo` | Simulated SPX, SPY and QQQ regular sessions, rotating on successive trading dates; `--option days=trend,chop --option speed=60` | none |
| Replay | `replay` | A recording played back as the whole feed, at 1×, 10×, 60× or full speed (`--option file=PATH --option speed=10`) | none |

Databento, Massive and ThetaData follow their documented APIs and are tested against
sample responses, but have not yet been run live with a key. If you have one, an
[issue](https://github.com/38st/openport/issues) saying how it went is welcome.

Tradier and tastytrade adapters read market data only. They never send broker
orders or read accounts. Credentials come from environment variables, never flags.
tastytrade requires a funded production account; its sandbox has no market data.
Tradier option sizes are read as contracts and DXLink times as milliseconds, each with
an option to override; IV and Greek scalings the brokers' documents leave unclear stay
missing rather than guessed.
See [broker operation and limitations](runtime.md#broker-market-data) before
using either feed for paper trading.

Providers deliver very different things: Databento sends raw exchange quotes with no
Greeks and no underlying price, while others ship their own Greeks. OpenPort normalises
all of them into the same contracts, quotes, volume and open interest, then computes
everything itself, so the numbers mean the same thing whichever provider you use.

To add a feed, see [writing a provider adapter](providers.md).

## Command-line flags

| Flags | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `--provider NAME`, `--poll-seconds N`, `--option KEY=VALUE` | The market-data provider and its settings, such as `quotes=cmbp-1` for Databento or `sandbox=true` for Tradier; Tradier validates poll intervals against its request budget |
| `--provider demo --option days=ID,ID,... --option speed=N` | Built-in regular scenarios in the given order; default all regular scenarios at 1×, supported speeds 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 300. Symbols default to their coverage. Network services are off; candles stay in memory unless `--candle-dir` is given |
| `--symbols SPX,SPY,QQQ,IWM,DIA`, `--expiries N`, `--window F` | The underlyings (default SPX, SPY, QQQ, IWM and DIA), the nearest N expiries and strikes within ±F of spot |
| `--rate R` | The rate assumed when no index curve is available |
| `--address`, `--port`, `--web-root`, `--allowed-origin`, `--allowed-host`, `--write-token`, `--write-token-file` | The web server and who may write (see [Security](#security)) |
| `--token-file FILE` | Named tokens: one `NAME SCOPES SECRET` per line, with comma-separated scopes and `#` comments |
| `--notify-config FILE` | Owner-only JSON file for notification channels and filters; alternatively `OPENPORT_NOTIFY_JSON` or channel environment variables ([setup](runtime.md#external-notifications)) |
| `--sandboxes N` | Offer up to N visitor accounts; 0 (default) disables them. Requires `--provider demo` and paper trading |
| `--sandbox-idle-seconds N` | Delete sandboxes after N seconds without authenticated use; default 86400 |
| `--client-ip-header NAME` | Use this proxy header for sandbox creation limits; unset uses the connection address |
| `--require-token` | Require a token for API reads, WebSocket ticks and writes, including loopback; static terminal files remain public |
| `--paper-journal PATH`, `--plan ID`, `--paper-cash`, `--paper-fee`, `--no-paper` | The main paper account (demo defaults to `~/.openport/demo/paper-journal.jsonl`); plan, cash and fee seed a new journal only. Rules selects optional fill models for a new attempt. Equity history is kept beside each journal as `.equity.csv`; playbook definitions and modes are in `playbooks.json` beside the main journal |
| `--scenario-dir DIR` | User JSON scenarios, listed after built-ins and overriding matching ids ([format](scenarios.md)) |
| `--backtest PLAYBOOK[@VERSION]`, `--days FILE`, `--recordings DIR`, `--scenarios N --seed S`, `--out REPORT.json` | Headless batch backtest under `--plan`; choose one day source. `--workers 1..16` defaults to 4; `--playbooks FILE` overrides the saved catalogue. [Inputs and reports](playbooks.md#batch-backtests) |
| `--verify-run JOURNAL` | Reproduce a saved replay or scenario from its recorded input and commands; exit 0 on matching transaction hashes and final equity, 1 otherwise |
| `--record FILE`, `--record-dir DIR` | Recording the feed to a file, or each run into a directory the Replay page reads |
| `--import-day databento\|thetadata --date YYYY-MM-DD --symbols SPX,SPY` | Import a completed past trading day and exit; accepts `--expiries N` and `--window F` |
| `--out DIR` | Import destination, default `./recordings`; select this directory with `--record-dir` to list its days in Replay |
| `--candle-dir DIR`, `--no-history` | Where chart history is kept, and whether Cboe backfills prices and volatility-index proxies ([price history](runtime.md#price-history)) |
| `--series-dir DIR`, `--no-series` | Local minute volatility history; defaults to `series` beside the candle directory, or disables collection ([storage](runtime.md#volatility-series-storage)) |
| `--backfill-series FILE...`, `--force` | Build metric history offline from recordings and exit; keep existing minutes unless forced; refuse demo recordings |
| `--dividends FILE\|massive` | Known cash dividends for held shares and American analytics: `SYMBOL,YYYY-MM-DD,AMOUNT` lines, the ex-date and dollars a share, taken from the fund's own schedule; or `massive` to read them from Massive's API every six hours with `MASSIVE_API_KEY` |
| `--events FILE` | Supplied `YYYY-MM-DD,Label` lines for the implied-session-move table; no event dates are bundled ([volatility](volatility.md)) |
| `--no-cboe-holidays` | Don't read Cboe's published holiday schedule, which lets a special closure it announces apply without a new build ([calendar](runtime.md#product-sessions-and-cboe-clocks)) |

Every value is range-checked; `openportd --help` lists every flag, and the
[runtime notes](runtime.md) cover the details.

## Terminal settings

| Terminal setting | Default | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status → Updates → Check for updates | Off | Browser update checks, saved in this browser |

Update checks are opt-in and off by default. When on, the web terminal itself, not
the server, asks `https://api.github.com/repos/38st/openport/releases/latest` at most
once a day. It compares that release with the running version from `GET /api/status`,
and shows a small dismissible notice with a link to the release when it is newer.
Nothing else is sent. A network failure stays silent.

## Security

openportd binds to 127.0.0.1 by default. Reads are public unless `--require-token`
is set; loopback writes without a configured legacy token remain open unless that
flag is set. The existing `OPENPORT_WRITE_TOKEN`, `--write-token TOKEN` and
`--write-token-file PATH` token grants `admin` and requires authentication for writes.
Named tokens from `--token-file FILE` grant `read`, `trade:ACCOUNT`, `trade:*`,
`replay` or `admin`. `replay` permits replay controls and backtest starts and
cancellation. `admin` includes account creation, limits, guardrails, resets,
the kill switch, playbook definitions and history deletion. Writes always check the token they carry;
without `--require-token`, reads ignore one that matches nothing, except expired
sandbox credentials when sandboxes are offered. The server prints
only the link for a token it keeps in a file, as the Docker image does, and never
prints named tokens. The token file is read at startup; protect it with owner-only
permissions and restart to rotate tokens. Send Bearer credentials over
HTTPS behind a reverse proxy for remote access. Static
files are confined to the web root, and WebSocket upgrades must come from the same
origin; behind a proxy that rewrites the Host header, list your public origin with
`--allowed-origin`. Every request must address the server by an IP address, `localhost`,
the host of an allowed origin, or a name given with `--allowed-host` (such as a proxy's
upstream name), so a web page cannot reach it through DNS rebinding. Check your data
provider's terms before sharing an instance with anyone else.
